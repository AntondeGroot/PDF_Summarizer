You are generating Obsidian notes as QUESTION CARDS for spaced repetition.

Topic: {{topic}}
Section: {{section}}
Chunk: {{chunkIndex}}/{{chunkCount}}

STRICT OUTPUT RULES:
- Output ONLY Markdown notes.
- Do NOT number the cards.
- Each card MUST follow this EXACT structure:

(clear, specific, conceptual question)
?
(concise answer)

- The line containing the single "?" must contain ONLY the character ? and nothing else.
- Each card MUST be separated by a line containing exactly:
---

- No extra lines before the first card.
- No extra lines after the last card.
- No extra blank lines anywhere except where shown in the structure.

Card format example (follow exactly):

What is diffusion?
?
Movement of particles from ==high concentration to low concentration==.

---

CARD SELECTION RULES (CRITICAL):

Only generate cards that meet at least one of these criteria:

- Explains WHY something exists
- Explains HOW something works
- Describes a mechanism or internal process
- Explains trade-offs or design decisions
- Clarifies relationships between concepts
- Prevents a common misconception
- Explains consequences of misuse

DO NOT generate cards about:
- Version numbers
- Release dates
- Minor command flags
- Exact syntax unless conceptually important
- Historical trivia
- Facts that do not improve practical understanding

Before generating a card, ask internally:
"Would forgetting this meaningfully harm conceptual understanding of the topic?"
If the answer is NO, do not generate a card about it.

- Use Obsidian cloze format when appropriate:
  Example:
  Diffusion moves from ==high concentration to low concentration==.
